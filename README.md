# Netflix_clone

The Netflix homepage project is a replica of the popular streaming service's landing page. It is created using HTML and CSS to mimic the layout and design of the original 
Netflix homepage. It features a header with the Netflix logo and navigation links, a hero section with a catchy headline and a call-to-action button, a section showcasing 
featured titles, and a simple footer with a copyright notice. The project allows learners to practice HTML and CSS skills while recreating the visual appeal and user experience
of the real Netflix homepage.
